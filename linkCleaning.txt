Identify different types of links and clean them up. 
    - Absolute links
    - Relative links
    - Same page links
    - JavaScript links
    - Protocol links

Ignore Same page links and JavaScript links.

Clean the links in the following way:
    - Add https: to the protocol links
    - Add the domain to the relative links
    - Remove the trailing /
    - Convert the link to lowercase
    - Remove fragments from the link(eg: #top)

Remove Duplicate links

Identify relevant links and irrelevant links. 
    - Relevant links are those that contain the domain name
    - Irrelevant links are those that do not contain the domain name
